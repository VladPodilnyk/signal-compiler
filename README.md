# *Slang* 
### What is _Slang_?
Slang is a translator from subset of  __Signal__ language, which was designed for an old series of USSR DSP processors, to assembler language.

### Repository structure
__legacy__ - contains old implementation of the translator which was written on Python. It was developed during Compiler development course in Kyiv Politechnic Institute.

__test__ - contains sample programs.

_Note_: Repository is under development. I want to introduce new version of translator. New implementation must be designed better than previous one (sadly, I designed very bad architecture) and maybe will have optimization options.
